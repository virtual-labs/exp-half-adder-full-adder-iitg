### Adders
Digital computers perform a varity of information processing tasks. Among the basic tasks encountered are the various arithmatic operartions. The moest basic arithmatic operation is the additon of two binary digits. This simple addition consist of 4 possible operations, they are 0+0=0, 0+1=1, 1+0=1, 1+1=1 and 1+1=10.

The first three operations produce a sum whose length is one digit, but when both augund and addend bits are equal to 1, the binary sum consists of two digits. The higher significant bit of this result is called a carry. When the augend and addend number contain more significant digits, the carry obtained from from the addition of two bits is added to the next higher order pair of significant bits. A combinational circuit that performs the addition of two bits is called a half adder. Again the combinational circuit that performs addition of three bits (Two significant bits and a previos carry) is called Full adder.

### Half Adder
A half adder is a combinational cuircuit with two binary inputs (augend and addend bits) and two binary outputs (sum and carry bits). It adds two inputs (A and B) and produces the sum (S) and the carry (C) bits. It is an arithmatic circuit used to perform the arithmatic operaton of addition of two single bit words.
